    <p class="principal">
        Turing was a founding father of artificial intelligence and of modern cognitive science, and he was a leading early exponent of the hypothesis that the human brain is in large part a digital computing machine. He theorized that the cortex at birth is an “unorganised machine” that through “training” becomes organized “into a universal machine or something like it.”
        <br/>
        Turing proposed what subsequently became known as the Turing test as a criterion for whether an artificial computer is thinking (1950).
