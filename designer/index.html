    <p class="principal"> 
        In 1945, the war over, Turing was recruited to the <abbr title="National Physical Laboratory">NPL</abbr> in London to create an electronic computer. His design for the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) was the first complete specification of an electronic stored-program all-purpose digital computer. Had Turing’s ACE been built as he planned, it would have had vastly more memory than any of the other early computers, as well as being faster. However, his colleagues at NPL thought the engineering too difficult to attempt, and a much smaller machine was built, the Pilot Model ACE (1950).

        <abbr title="National Physical Laboratory">NPL</abbr> lost the race to build the world’s first working electronic stored-program digital computer—an honour that went to the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester in June 1948. Discouraged by the delays at <abbr title="National Physical Laboratory">NPL</abbr>, Turing took up the deputy directorship of the Computing Machine Laboratory in that year (there was no director). His earlier theoretical concept of a universal Turing machine had been a fundamental influence on the Manchester computer project from the beginning. After Turing’s arrival at Manchester, his main contributions to the computer’s development were to design an input-output system—using Bletchley Park technology—and to design its programming system. He also wrote the first-ever programming manual, and his programming system was used in the Ferranti Mark I, the first marketable electronic digital computer (1951).
